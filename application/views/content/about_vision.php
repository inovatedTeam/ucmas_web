                                    <p>UCMAS (Universal Concept Mental Arithmetic System) – an ISO 9001:2008 certified course, is a unique child development program that was founded in Malaysia by Dr. Dino Wong.</p>
                                    <p>Universal Concept Mental Arithmetic System – UCMAS started its operations in North America in the year 2004 and has currently about 70 locations across the network. With over 30,000 students registered across these centers and approximately 600 Course Instructors trained, UCMAS is now a brand to reckon with.</p>
                                    <p>About the Concept</p>
                                    <p>The UCMAS program is based on the ancient, simple but powerful Abacus tool that provides countable beads for children to visualize numbers. Children learn to manipulate those beads to perform arithmetic calculation such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.</p>
                                    <p>UCMAS children are trained in rapid math calculation with the help of physical abacus. Later, they move on to mental calculations where they develop the ability to picture the abacus in their minds and calculate quickly. The crucial concept of visualization or thinking in pictures leverages the right brain and leads to dramatically higher levels of speed, efficiency and accuracy. </p>
                                    <p>The UCMAS program incorporates and enhances Auditory, Visual and Kinesthetic/Tactile learning styles in each child. It fosters active learning and activates key cognitive functions such as:</p>


                                    <p>This improves their confidence and self-esteem and helps children become motivated leaners – the best route to success in academics and beyond. </p>
